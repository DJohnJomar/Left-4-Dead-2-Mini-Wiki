                <p>The story takes place in Savannah, Georgia, after the events in The Sacrifice. The four survivors climb up the roof to witness the last rescue helicopter leave the rooftop of The Vannah. They decide to go to a mall, where a second evacuation point is located. While on their way, they learn each others names: Ellis, Coach, Rochelle and Nick. After an encounter with Whitaker, the survivors enter the mall to discover that it is overrun, with all CEDA agents at the center either dead or infected. The group enters the mall's atrium to discover Jimmy Gibbs Jr.'s stock car and, following Ellis's plan, fuel up the car to break out of the mall where they head to New Orleans, rumored to be the last standing city in America.</p>

                <p>The four then arrive at the raised bridge in Rayford, where they meet Francis, Louis and Zoey. The late Bill sacrificed his life to raise the bridge, and Louis had been wounded by a Witch as the group explored Rayford. Because the new survivors need to cross the bridge, they must find another way across and refill the generator. After battling through a wedding, the streets, and a "historical sewer", they meet up with the original survivors again, who help cover the new survivors while they fend off the Infected in order to fill the generator and lower the bridge.</p>

                <p>They continue driving until they reach Griffin County, where they find the highway is completely blocked by abandoned vehicles, thus forcing them to proceed on foot through miles of abandoned cars where they find a distant search light. The lights are revealed to come from Whispering Oaks Amusement Park. As they fight their way through the Park and navigate to its stadium, Coach comes up with an idea to use the concert equipment in The Peach Pit, abandoned by Midnight Riders, to attract the helicopter pilot's attention. The plan works, and the Survivors manage to evacuate in the helicopter as the masses of Infected swarm the stadium.</p>

                <p>After being rescued, the helicopter pilot becomes infected, prompting Nick to shoot him and cause the helicopter to crash. The Survivors exit the wrecked helicopter to find that they have landed in a bayou. They discover a small village, where the villagers decided to fend for themselves, but ultimately failed as they were overrun. Working their way through the swamp, the survivors come across a crashed plane, dead military paratroopers, and infected swamp villagers. The previous survivors had informed any passerby to head to the Plantation House. When the survivors head there, they find a radio, which they use to contact Virgil for rescue. After fending off the horde, Virgil blasts the Plantation gate open to allow the survivors to escape on his boat before the horde could overwhelm them.</p>

                <p>On their way to New Orleans, Virgil's boat runs low on fuel and drops off the survivors at Ducatel, Mississippi to find gas. The survivors forget the gun bag, and the local gas station is out of gas which forces them to go to the next gas station two miles away. After passing through an abandoned sugar mill infested with Witches, they find the gas station. After collecting their fuel, they begin to head back when stormy weather hits. Going all the way back to the Burger Tank, Coach comes up with the idea to use the Burger Tank's sign to signal Virgil. They succeed, and Virgil arrives to pick them up before the Survivors are overwhelmed by the Infected.</p>

                <p>Virgil drops the group off at New Orleans, where Coach is immediately reinvigorated as they see fighter jets in the sky, revealing that the military has not abandoned the city yet; Nick however is skeptical about their presence. They decide that the bridge in the distance is the best chance of survival, but discover the corpses of non-infected people on the way. The survivors suspect that the military took over CEDA's pitiful attempts to contain the situation as they find themselves in an area being bombed by the military, and quicken their pace to the bridge. They interrupt a transmission on the bridge between the two military personnel: Papa Gator and Rescue 7, who suspect that the Survivors are Carriers. Rescue 7 is prepared to carry the Carriers, and Papa Gator informs the Survivors that they are lucky as the Military had just left the area, and that they must reach the other side of the bridge for rescue. The Survivors fight through the Infected amassed on the bridge and reach Rescue 7. As he carries the Survivors out, the fighter jets bomb the bridge to prevent the Infected from leaving the city and the pilot takes the Survivors out to a military cruise ship at sea.</p>
